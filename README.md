FooStriods
==========

A neat little self learning asteroid-like game. To be put up on the FooBar computer at UU.

It's slightly more than halfway done.

Each of the ships is equipped with a very basic AI. Which is simply just a direct mapping from inputs(what the craft can see) to actions.

The population evolves trough a tournament select system. Although as of now its not really a tournament.
Three battles with different crafts (no craft appears in two battles) gets played and from these
the two best scoring crafts mate and produce an offspring. The worst scoring craft get's removed and the offspring will take its place.  It uses a random crossover method to generate the offspring.

More detailed description of what the hell goes on will come later.
